# MLH Registration Autofill

Simple playwright script to take in CSV of data (with first name, last name, NetID) and add all participants automatically. You'll need to create a .env file based off of the .env.example file and fill in your credentials. The CSV file by default is called names.csv. This automatically appends the NYU email extension when filling out the information.
